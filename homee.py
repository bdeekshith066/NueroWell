It encompasses various therapies, including physical, occupational, and speech therapy, tailored to individual needs. Rehabilitation efforts focus on restoring lost functions, enhancing mobility, and promoting overall well-being.   \n  \n  Treatment Approaches  \n   Rehabilitation after stroke involves a multidisciplinary approach, combining therapeutic exercises, assistive devices, and adaptive strategies. Physical therapy aims to improve strength, coordination, and mobility, while occupational therapy focuses on relearning daily activities and enhancing fine motor skills. Speech therapy addresses communication difficulties and swallowing disorders, facilitating language and cognitive recovery.  \n  \n Support and Progress  \n  Stroke rehabilitation is a gradual process, and progress varies for each individual. Support from healthcare professionals, caregivers, and support groups is invaluable during this journey. Setting realistic goals and celebrating milestones can boost morale and motivation. With dedication and perseverance, many stroke survivors experience significant improvements in function and quality of life through rehabilitation  \n  \n

            "aphasia" : """ :orange[Aphasia]  \n  Understanding Aphasia  \n Aphasia is a complex neurological condition that affects a person's ability to communicate effectively. It often occurs as a result of brain damage, typically from a stroke, brain injury, or neurological disorder. Individuals with aphasia may struggle with speaking, understanding language, reading, and writing, which can significantly impact their daily lives and interpersonal relationships.  \n - Types and Symptoms  \n -  There are different types of aphasia, each with its unique symptoms and severity. Expressive aphasia, for example, impairs a person's ability to speak fluently and form coherent sentences, while receptive aphasia affects comprehension and understanding of spoken or written language. Additionally, individuals may experience difficulty finding the right words (anomia) or struggle with language repetition. These symptoms vary depending on the location and extent of brain damage.  \n - Treatment and Support  \n  While there is no cure for aphasia, various therapies and interventions can help individuals manage and improve their communication skills. Speech and language therapy, cognitive rehabilitation, and assistive communication devices are commonly used to address aphasia's challenges. Moreover, support groups and counseling provide emotional support and practical strategies for coping with the condition. With proper treatment and support, many individuals with aphasia can regain some level of language function and lead fulfilling lives.  \n - Prompt recognition of heart attack symptoms and calling emergency services (911) is crucial for timely treatment.  \n - Treatment options include medications (aspirin, nitroglycerin), angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass surgery.  \n - Rehabilitation and lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, smoking cessation) are vital for recovery and prevention of future events.  \n

            "ischemic stroke": """ :orange[About and Facts]  \n Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke, accounting for about 87% of all stroke cases. It occurs when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain is obstructed, usually by a blood clot. This blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain's tissues, leading to cell death and potential brain damage. There are two main types of ischemic strokes: thrombotic, caused by a clot forming in an artery directly leading to the brain, and embolic, where a clot forms elsewhere in the body and travels to the brain.  \n  \n  :orange[Symptoms:]  \n - Cardiac arrest is different from a heart attack and requires immediate intervention with CPR and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED).  \n - Survival rates decrease by 7-10% for every minute without CPR or defibrillation.  \n -  Effective bystander CPR can significantly increase the chances of survival and reduce disability.  \n
